The simplifier is a term rewriting system for the theories of bitvector and arrays.
Currently only a fraction of the final rewriting rules are implemented.

The simplifier's architecture consists of many different simplification passes that have a unique
and distinct simplification job within the entire simplification procedure.
The simplifier calls those simplification passes similar as to how a modern compiler invokes its
semantic checking and optimizing passes over the abstract code.

This `README` will contain a brief description of all simplification passes as well as a list
of all expressions and their associated simplification rules and their connection to the passes
to provide readers of this `README` an overview of all simplification rules and passes.
