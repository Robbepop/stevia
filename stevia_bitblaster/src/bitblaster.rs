//! Streaming-Bitblaster data structure.
//!
//! These data structures allow for an efficient conversion into CNF
//! and should also make it quite easy to convert into AIG if needed.
//! Also they allow for a higher-level bit blaster implementation
//! than when directly constructing CNF or AIG.
//! 
//! As with CNF this data structure allows for a streaming bit blaster
//! implementation that does not need to allocate temporary data structures
//! for partial construction.
//! 
//! This has the effect that after streaming conversion to CNF one could
//! simply and directly forward this to an IPASIR implementing SAT
//! solver in an efficient way.
