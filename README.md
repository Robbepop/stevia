This is a brave attempt to write a simple [SMT][smt-wiki] solver in the [Rust][rust-home] ([github][rust-repo]) programming language based on the design of [STP][stp-home] ([github][stp-repo]).  

Currently the solver is in very early development phase.

## Very future goals are
- Support for [SMTLib 2.6][smtlib-home].
- Theories of quantifier-free bitvectors and arrays: `QF_ABV`
- Comprehensive documentation for all important parts of the code.
- Eventually be able to keep up with other SMT solvers like STP.
- C API to enable bindings for other languages.
- Use an efficient SAT solver under the hood, like [candy][candy-repo].

## Simplifications

Stevia will support a great machinery of simplifications to its input formulas.
An early example of what is possible now:

```lisp
(=
  (=
    (=
      false
      (= (_ :32  42) (_ :32 1337) )
    )
    (= (_ :32 42) (_ :32 42) )
  )
  (=
    (= (not true) (= true (not true) ) )
    (= ; Here is the break: true is not false!
      (and true true)
      (= (_ :64 100) (-(-(_ :64 100))) )
    )
  )
)
```

Is getting simplified to this:

```lisp
false
```

Keep in mind that this is still a pretty naive simplification. More to come in future versions of Stevia!
