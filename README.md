---

This is a brave attempt to write a simple [SMT][smt-wiki] solver in the [Rust][rust-home] ([github][rust-repo]) programming language.

It is based on the design of:

- [STP][stp-home] ([github][stp-repo])
- [Boolector][boolector-home].

Currently the solver is in very early development phase.

## Supported Theories (SMT)

- Bitvectors of fixed bit-width and modulo-two arithmetics.
- Non-extensional arrays, indexed by bitvectors with bitvector values.
- Only supports quantifier-free inputs.

The combined theory in SMT notation is called `QF_ABV`.

## Very future goals are

- Support inputs specified in [SMTLib 2.6][smtlib-home].
- Comprehensive documentation for all important parts of the code.
- Eventually be able to keep up with efficient SMT solvers like STP.
- C API to enable bindings for other languages.
- Use an efficient SAT solver under the hood, like [candy][candy-repo] and [JamSat][jamsat-repo].

## Simplifications

Stevia supports word-level transformations, called simplifications, that it applies throughout the solving process.

Below is an early example of what is possible by now. Keep in mind that this is still a WIP and there is certainly
more to come in future versions of the simplifier.

LISP syntax of an arithmetic instance:

```lisp
(+ x 42 (- x y) (* y (-5)) (- (+ x 10 y)))
```

Is simplified to:

```lisp
(+ 32 (* -7 y) x)
```

This output can then be further processed by other simplification and solving processes.

## Unstable Features Used

These features need to be stabilized before this crate can be used on the stable channel.
