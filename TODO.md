# TODO-List for Stevia

## Critical TODO's

- Add a `ty: Type` field to all non-boolean expressions and implement `NaiveExprFactory` for them.
- Finally add an attribute to `SmtExpr` proc. macro to set the expression type explicitely. (Is this needed if `ty: Type` detection works?)
- Implement a macro to simplify building up extression trees.

## Short term TODO's

- Implement `Context` for handling symbols and their associated metadata. Used by factories.
- Implement `simple_type_check` method to naively check the children's type of a newly created expression for validity. This can be used by factory implementations that want to check for this addional safety guard.
- Implement attribute support for SmtExpr proc macro to improve controlling of auto generated AST code.
- Implement expression creation macro based on the syntax of SMTLib2.
- Implement generic recursive AST consumer that acts as a base for optimizations and other AST mutation operations.

## Long term TODO's

- Implement simplifier based on generic recursive AST consumer.
- Find and depend on decent Bitvector library implementation.
- Find and depend on decent library implementation similar to STP's `libabc` for and inverter graph (AIG) computation..
- Add SMTLib2.X serialization and deserialization support.

## Considerations

- Rename `ExprTrait` to `IExpr`.
- Maybe remove `into_variant` from `ExprTrait` and put it into `IntoVariant` as new trait and make it possible to auto `impl From<T: IntoVariant> for ExprVariant { .. }`
